## Why performance matters

---

## User experience

Users studies have shown that page speed is the number one factor in user experience.

# What is performance? 

* It is **not** as simple as how many seconds it takes for a page to load.
* There are a number of other **milestones** we can measure on the way to a complete page load that help define performance.
* It is **relative**: What the user wants to do, what their connection speed is, the power of their device.
* New visitors and repeat visitors have a different experience.

---

## Web Vitals

Google created a set of Web Vitals that help us think about (and measure) unique facets of performance experience.

---

## Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are a subset of these metrics they have determined are the most meaningful.

---

![bg left:40% 70%](/assets/lcp_ux.svg)
# Largest Contentful Paint

[Measures](https://web.dev/lcp/) the time until the page displays what is likely its main content, like a hero image or heading

---

![width:800px](/assets/lcp-example-1.png)
![width:800px](/assets/lcp-example-2.png)

---

![bg left:40% 70%](/assets/fid_ux.svg)
# First Input Delay

measures the interactivity of the page, from the user's first interaction to the time the page responds to it.
_Field only metric (not in Lighthouse)_

---

![width:1000px](/assets/fid-diagram.svg)

---

![bg left:40% 70%](/assets/cls_ux.svg)
# Cumulative Layout Shift

measures the degree of layout instability on the page, due to shifts like asynchronously loaded content being injected

---

<video width="700" class="bg" poster="/assets/play.svg" onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause(); this.blur()" onpause="">
    <source src="/assets/layout-instability2.webm" type="video/mp4">
</video>

---

# Other Web Vitals


---

# Speed Index (SI)

[Measures](https://web.dev/speed-index/) how quickly content is visually displayed during page load. Lighthouse first captures a video of the page loading in the browser and computes the visual progression between frames.
  
---

![width:1000px](/assets/speed-index-histogram.png)

---

# First Contentful paint (FCP)

[Measures](https://web.dev/fcp/) the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen.

---

![width:1000px](/assets/fcp-example.png)

---

# Time to Interactive (TTI)

[Measures](https://web.dev/tti/) the time from when the page starts loading to when it's visually rendered, its initial scripts (if any) have loaded, and it's capable of reliably responding to user input quickly.

---

![width:1000px](/assets/tti-diagram.svg)

---

# Total Blocking Time (TBT)

[Measures](https://web.dev/tbt/) the total amount of time between FCP and TTI where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.

# Lighthouse

---

**There are multiple ways to use Lighthouse.**

* [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights) . Run Lighthouse and link to reports without installing a thing.
* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) . Easily audit pages that require authentication, and read your reports in a user-friendly format.
* [Command Line Interface](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#cli) . Automate your Lighthouse runs via shell scripts.
* [Node module](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#programmatic) . Integrate Lighthouse into your continuous integration systems.

### Downside
* No easy way to export
* No "settings"
* Website must be public

### Upside
* Very easy
* Includes "field data" (limited available data)
* API - Can use this as a service to automate or build an application.

---

# Field data vs. Lab data

**Field data:** The Chrome User Experience Report is powered by real user measurement of key user experience metrics across the public web, aggregated from users who have opted-in to syncing their browsing history, have not set up a Sync passphrase, and have usage statistic reporting enabled.

# Performance goals

Good performance is contextual. So set goals based on those contexts.

1) See content 
2) Click a thing


---
# Performance budgets

Lighthouse can run an audit against your goals and deliver a report showing how your goals match up.
