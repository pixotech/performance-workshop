---

# What is performance? 

* It is **not** as simple as how many seconds it takes for a page to load.
* There are a number of other **milestones** we can measure on the way to a complete page load that help define performance.
* It is **relative**: What the user wants to do, what their connection speed is, the power of their device.
* New visitors and repeat visitors have a different experience.

---

## Web Vitals

Google created a set of Web Vitals that help us think about (and measure) unique facets of performance experience.

---

## Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are a subset of these metrics they have determined are the most meaningful.

![width:1000px](assets/core-web-vitals.png)

---

![bg left:40% 70%](assets/lcp_ux.svg)
# Largest Contentful Paint

[Measures](https://web.dev/lcp/) the time until the page displays what is likely its main content, like a hero image or heading

---

![width:800px](assets/lcp-example-1.png)
![width:800px](assets/lcp-example-2.png)

---

![bg left:40% 70%](assets/fid_ux.svg)
# First Input Delay

measures the interactivity of the page, from the user's first interaction to the time the page responds to it.
_Field only metric (not in Lighthouse)_

---

![width:1000px](assets/fid-diagram.svg)

---

![bg left:40% 70%](assets/cls_ux.svg)
# Cumulative Layout Shift

measures the degree of layout instability on the page, due to shifts like asynchronously loaded content being injected

---

<video width="700" class="bg" poster="/assets/play.svg" onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause(); this.blur()" onpause="">
    <source src="/assets/layout-instability2.webm" type="video/mp4">
</video>

---

# Other Web Vitals


---

# Speed Index (SI)

[Measures](https://web.dev/speed-index/) how quickly content is visually displayed during page load. Lighthouse first captures a video of the page loading in the browser and computes the visual progression between frames.
  
---

![width:1000px](/assets/speed-index-histogram.png)

---

# First Contentful paint (FCP)

[Measures](https://web.dev/fcp/) the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen.

---

![width:1000px](/assets/fcp-example.png)

---

# Time to Interactive (TTI)

[Measures](https://web.dev/tti/) the time from when the page starts loading to when it's visually rendered, its initial scripts (if any) have loaded, and it's capable of reliably responding to user input quickly.

---

![width:1000px](/assets/tti-diagram.svg)

---

# Total Blocking Time (TBT)

[Measures](https://web.dev/tbt/) the total amount of time between FCP and TTI where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.

# Lighthouse

---

**There are multiple ways to use Lighthouse.**

* [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights) . Run Lighthouse and link to reports without installing a thing.
* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) . Easily audit pages that require authentication, and read your reports in a user-friendly format.
* [Command Line Interface](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#cli) . Automate your Lighthouse runs via shell scripts.
* [Node module](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#programmatic) . Integrate Lighthouse into your continuous integration systems.

### Downside
* No easy way to export
* No "settings"
* Website must be public

### Upside
* Very easy
* Includes "field data" (limited available data)
* API - Can use this as a service to automate or build an application.

---

# Field data vs. Lab data

**Field data:** The Chrome User Experience Report is powered by real user measurement of key user experience metrics across the public web, aggregated from users who have opted-in to syncing their browsing history, have not set up a Sync passphrase, and have usage statistic reporting enabled.

# Performance goals

Good performance is contextual. So set goals based on those contexts.

1) See content 
2) Click a thing


---
# Performance budgets

`lighthouse --budget-path budget-sample.json https://pixotech.com`

- Lighthouse can run an audit against your goals and show when you are making too many requests or too large of files in categories.
- There is no one set budget, but recommend always setting one
- Download our sample budget with all options on [github.com](https://github.com/pixotech/performance-workshop/blob/production/lighthouse-sample-configs/budget-sample.json)
- can only be used with cli or ci version

# Activity
## Test your site with Network tab waterfall

  - Is your main html page fast?
  - How many tiers of loads do you have?
  - What is/are your slow resources?

---

# Number of Concurrent Connections

Number of seperate resources that need to be loaded matters.

- Chrome 89 == **6**
- Firefox 68 == **9**
- Edge 18 == **12**

---

# Server Default Concurrent Connections

- Apache == **150**
- nginx == **512**
- iis == **5000**

Without load testing and tuning, these numbers are just limits

- is a simple command line tool to place load on a webserver
    - `brew install hey` or download from https://github.com/rakyll/hey
- Be careful running the default settings
    - `hey https://poor-performance.pixodev.net` 50/s for 250 requests
    - `hey -n 5000 -c 10 https://poor-performance.pixodev.net` 10 requests per second for 5000 total requests 
    - `hey -z 10m -c 5 https://poor-performance.pixodev.net` runs for 10m with 5 requests per second

# nginx

- Created in 2002 to solve the `C10k` issue for Rambler search engine
- Designed to outperform Apache, not as flexible
- Uses a different paradigm to avoid fork bombing and uses much less memory
- Its more difficult to setup, lots of docker containers just have apache
- Alot of its default settings have performance in mind, its just newer

---

# Take a BREAK

When you return we will cover common lighthouse issues

---

# Common Lighthouse Issues

- HTTP/2
- Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy
- Properly size images
  
- Image elements do not have explicit width and height
- Avoid enormous network payloads
- Minimize main-thread work

---

![image](assets/webserver-market.png)
https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/

---

# HTTP/2
- introduced May 2015, support added in Chrome 51
- Tries to fix the concept of multiple separate connections to the same server by opening a stream and pushing multiple requests through it.

---

 ![width:700px](assets/http2.png)

---

# Enable HTTP/2

  - apache `a2enmod http2`
  - nginx change site setting: `listen 443 ssl http2;`


  - https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test
    ![width:500px](assets/http2-test.png)

---

# HTTP/3
- Introduced Feb 2021
- Replaces `TCP` for `QUIC` (pronounced QUICK) which is roughly a modified `UDP`
- TCP doesn't like out of order packet
- 14% of web servers, 7% of desktops, 0% of mobile support it (April 2021)
- (Chrome 79*, firefox 72*, safari 14)

---

# Gzip / Brotli

  - Module for Apache/nginx that compresses files in transit (mostly html, css, and js) during the transfer

  - gzip 78%, brotli 82% savings over uncompressed text

  - `mod_deflate` or `mod_gzip` or `mod_brotli`

---

https://tools.keycdn.com/brotli-test

![width:700px](assets/gzip-result.png)

---

# ahaslides.com/WEBCON

---

# Efficient cache policy 
  - Add headers `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000 public`
  - Apache or Nginx create or edit the root `.htaccess`
 ```
<FilesMatch ".(gif|jpg|jpeg|png|ico)$">
    Header set Cache-Control "max-age=#####"
</FilesMatch>
 ```
  - `86400` = 1 day, `2419200` = 1 month, `29030400` = 1 year

---

# Cache-Control Headers

## public
The response may be stored in any cache

## private
The response may be stored only in the browser's cache

---

# Cache-Control Headers

## no-cache
The response may be stored by any cache, even if the response is normally non-cacheable. However, the stored response MUST always go through validation with the origin server first before using it.

## no-store
The response may not be stored in any cache. Note that this will not prevent a valid pre-existing cached response being returned. Clients can set max-age=0

---

# Etag
  - Check the file hash to see if it has changed from the cached version
  - Most servers automatically add etag for you to static assets
  - `304 Not Modified`
  - `etag: "2d9d-5a31a59c7b011-gzip"`

# When to use lhci instead of lighthouse
  - You want automated runs of lighthouse with a config file running the entire process
  - You can still script `lighthouse`
  - You want to upload to a particular destination

---

`.lighthouserc.json` in the root directory (or .yaml or .js)
```
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
       "url": ["https://pixotech.com/"],
       "numberOfRuns": 3
    },
    "assert": {
       "preset": "lighthouse:all" ,
       "budgetFile": "budget.json"
    },
    "upload": {
      "target": "lhci",
      "token": "56d601b2-342a-1234-1234-9ae4f8721e9e",
      "serverBaseUrl": "https://pixo:pixo@lighthouse-ci.pixodev.net/"
    }
  }
}

# Getting started with lhci

```
FOLDER_NAME=steve-zazeski-com-lighthouse

mkdir ${FOLDER_NAME}
cd ${FOLDER_NAME}
git init
git branch daily-test && git checkout daily-test
vi .lighthouserc.json

git commit --allow-empty -m "Run for `date -u +%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M`"
lhci autorun
```

[configuration](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)



---

# Lighthouse with Jenkins

If the executor has chrome, lighthouse, lhci installed:
```
lhci autorun
```

If you are using a docker node and give it the `.lighthouserc.json`
```
docker container run --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --rm \
  --cpus="1" --shm-size=2g \
  -v "$(pwd)/lhci-data:/home/lhci/reports/.lighthouseci" \
  patrickhulce/lhci-client \
  lhci autorun
```

add `.github/workflows/audit.yml` file with:
```
name: Performance Audit
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-lates
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Use Node.js 12.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - name: Install
        run: |

# DNS

- Penalty you pay on first load of a sub/domain
- Fast sites lookup in ~20ms
- Normal sites lookup less than ~100ms

`dig pixotech.com` mac linux
`nslookup -debug pixotech.com` win

```
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> pixotech.com
;pixotech.com.			IN	A
pixotech.com.		77	IN	A	52.34.48.14
;; Query time: 82 msec
```

---

# DNS - CNAMES

- All DNS queries recurse until they end in A / AAAA record

```
build.pixotech.com.	299	IN	CNAME	on-premise-docker-swarm.pixodev.net.
on-premise-docker-swarm.pixodev.net. 59	IN CNAME icarus.pixodev.net.
icarus.pixodev.net.	59	IN	A	173.167.185.184

;; Query time: 219 msec
```

---

# Fastest DNS Resolution

- Bare A Records if possible
- Higher TTLs (median is 300)
    - 1800s = microsoft.com
    - 300s = facebook.com gmail.com youtube.com google.com apple.com
    - upstream dns typically do not acknowledge a TTL of less than 30 seconds.

# PWA

Progressive web apps are coming with moderate support on iOS and Android.

- JS code that can run offline through service workers
- Cache layer for offline
- Be careful with service workers updating (create-react-app)

# Recap

---

- lighthouse checks via `online`, `devtools`, `cli` or `ci`
- Look at the waterfall for bottlenecks
- Enable Server Caching
- Enable Server Compression (gzip or brotli)
- Use monitoring (statuscake)
- Test your site with load before someone else does
- Fix just the worse thing at the moment, then repeat
- Don't let best get in the way of better
